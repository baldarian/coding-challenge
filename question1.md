What comes into mind that JavaScript is backward compatible language meaning it can't depracate and remove features in future versions. That makes it impossible to remove bad APIs or fix wrong dicisions made 25 years ago.
Another thing is that JS is loosely typed. Meaning 1 + '1' gives you '11' and doesn't throw an error.

Probably there're a lot more but can't remember ATM :)
